# Recommendations

## Number of units to order 1

Using the sample data in Exhibit 10, make a recommendation for how many units of each style
Wally Obermeyer should order during the initial phase of production. Assume that there is no
minimum order size requirement, and that Obermeyer’s initial production commitment must be
at least 10,000 units. Assume that an initial order of 10,000 units leaves sufficient capacity for
the second order.

Assuming the demand distribution of each Parka to be a normal distribution with mean equal to the mean of forecasts, and the standard deviation being 2 times the individual forecasts standard deviations, we can use a Monte Carlo method to simulate the expected times the demand is not met, and with a confidence interval, and we use this to propose an initial order value

Let the true distribution of demand for each Parka be $D \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we don't know the true value of $\mu$. We have an estimator $\hat{D} \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}^2)$ given by the individual forecasts of several heads of departments. So we say that, what we want to accomplish is to find, for each Parka, the amount to order so that the order value is below the expected value. If the distribution of D is indeed normal, we know that:

$$E[D] = \mu$$

Ideally, we would order exactly the expected amount plus some margin for error. Therefore, we can model the order amount as:

$$h(X) \rightarrow o_p = D_p + m_p$$
The Monte Carlo method gives us that:

$$\hat{h_n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{j=1}h(x_j) \rightarrow \int_xh(x)f(x)dx = E_f[h(X)]$$
Hence, we will create a distribution to approximate the random variable D. In that way, we can formulate the problem as an optimization problem, such that:

$$min\ c$$
**Subject to**
$$\sum_{p=1}^ko_p \le 10000$$
$$o_p > 0$$
$$o_p - D_p - m_p \le c$$
$$c \in [0,1]$$

## Number of units to order 2
Using the sample data in Exhibit 10, make a recommendation for how many units of each style
Wally Obermeyer should order during the initial phase of production. Assume that all ten styles
in the sample problem are made in Hong Kong (a minimum commitment of 600 units per style
ordered), and that Obermeyer’s initial production commitment must be at least 10,000 units.
Ignore price differences among styles in your initial analysis. Clearly spell out the methodology
you have used to make your ordering decisions, and the logic behind your methodology

## What-if 1: All production from China
Repeat your analysis, now assuming that all styles are made in China. What differences (if any)
result?

## Recommended operational changes:
What operational changes would you recommend to Wally to improve performance? Clearly list
the expected benefits from each change. Please try and be very specific in terms of the changes
and benefits in response to this question

### Change 1: (...)
### Change 2: (...)

## Decision making process on sourcing
How should Obermeyer management think (both short term and long term) about sourcing in
Hong Kong versus China? What sourcing policy would you recommend?
